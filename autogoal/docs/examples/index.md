# AutoGOAL examples

The following examples illustrate the use of AutoGOAL is more practical scenarios.

These three examples conform the experimentation for the paper
`Solving Heterogenous AutoML Problems with AutoGOAL` presented at the 7th Workshop on AutoML in ICML 2020.

* [Optimizing seven UCI repository datasets](./solving_uci_datasets)
* [Optimizing the HAHA 2019 challenge](./solving_haha_2019)
* [Optimizing the MEDDOCAN 2019 challenge](./solving_meddocan_2019)

These are other examples focusing on distinct features of AutoGOAL.

* [Building an scikit-learn classificiation pipeline](./sklearn_simple_grammar)
